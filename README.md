WIP!

Womp editor is a personal project of mine, and is not (yet) fully functional or safe (yet ??). It does not even support opening or closing files!!

Current implementation is built using ncurses and supports a customizable load in screen using figlet (change the EDITOR_NAME macro, though I have no idea what happens when you give it too much text :D).

I fully plan to make this fully functional and (perhaps) use it personally. I want the womp editor to have a personal touch, and to be littered with easter eggs and chance encounters to lightens one day programming in the terminal :) .

Run using make. If compiling make sure to link ncurses ( -lncurses ).
